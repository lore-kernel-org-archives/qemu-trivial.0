I don't know much about it either. I could not find docs about framebuffer 
endianness of this device but all clients I've seen treat it as little 
endian, both on little endian SH4 and big endian PPC. Maybe the previous 
code was already broken, because on a black & white text console (like the 
SH4 test image listed on qemu.org) the problem is not obvious, it still 
looks like white text on black with mixed up color components. It can only 
be seen when some graphics is displayed like the Tux logo on framebuffer 
in the above Debian image. If it ever worked it could have been easily 
broken by some qemu console changes. Or maybe it worked on big endian host 
only but I could not verify that. All I can say it works for me now on LE 
host with both LE and BE guests that I could test.
