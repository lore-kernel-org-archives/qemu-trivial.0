I'm confused.  Both qdev_get_machine() and
qdev_get_machine_unchecked() still return the object at
"/machine".  On softmmu, /machine will be of type TYPE_MACHINE.
On user-only, /machine will be of type "container".

I believe Markus is suggesting that avoiding unwanted side
effects is even better than doing type checking after it's
already too late.  In other words, it doesn't make sense to call
container_get("/machine") on system emulation mode.

This part confuses me as well.  qdev_get_machine_unchecked() is
used in both user-only and softmmu, isn't?  Thus we can't say it
is only used in user-only mode.

I think we all agree that qdev_get_machine() should eventually be
available in softmmu only.

But I don't think we agree when it would be appropriate to call
qdev_get_machine_unchecked() instead of qdev_get_machine().

On both examples in your patch, the code checks for TYPE_MACHINE
immediately after calling qdev_get_machine_unchecked().  If that
code is only useful in softmmu mode, when would anybody want to
call qdev_get_machine_unchecked() in user-only mode?
