For a very long time we have used 'uname -s' as our fallback if
we don't identify the target OS using a compiler #define. This
obviously doesn't work for cross-compilation, and we've had
a comment suggesting we fix this in configure for a long time.
Since we now have an exhaustive list of which OSes we can run
on (thanks to commit 898be3e0415 making an unrecognized OS
be a fatal error), we know which ones we're missing.

Add check_define tests for the remaining OSes we support.  The
defines checked are based on ones we already use in the codebase for
identifying the host OS (with the exception of GNU/kFreeBSD).
We can now set bogus_os immediately rather than doing it later.

We leave the comment about uname being bad untouched, since
there is still a use of it for the fallback for unrecognized
host CPU type.

All of these OSes except OSX are on the "not actually supported"
list, so I don't care very much if we break them.  I did sanity check
FreeBSD and NetBSD which are the two most plausible ones to
get back into supported status.
