The benefit I see is that we now have a single way to access the
existing global state instead of two.

I agree qdev_get_machine() has many issues.  I dislike
qdev_get_machine() a lot, and I think I had suggested we stop
using it and use current_machine instead.

But at least now we have one imperfect API instead of two
imperfect APIs.  I do think this makes future clean up work
easier.
