For a quickie patch, I make my edits, then 'git commit -a -s' and 'git
send-email -1' - but that works because I've already set up git hooks to
auto-cc the list, and I already debugged my 'get send-email' setup years
ago.  So yeah, doing it from a completely virgin environment could
benefit from a complete command line that reproduces what I take for
granted in my normal environment.  And some email setups are a lot
friendlier than others (I personally do not use gmail, but will readily
admit that it is probably a lot easier to set up my work emails to use
Red Hat's SMTP servers than it is for a gmail contributor to get their
email setup working in a way that does not mangle patches).

But nothing requires you to set up a certificate to submit a patch.  I'm
not sure which piece of the documentation got you steered in that
direction, but gpg signing of patches is only required of maintainers,
not contributors (or maybe you're hinting at the extra effort required
to set up gmail as a valid 'git send-email' target, to which I have no
experience, but which starts to leave the realm of qemu-specific
instructions into something where it would be better to link to a good
git setup tutorial, if one exists).

Thanks for that feedback.  It's often hard for a core contributor to
remember what it was like to submit their first patch years ago, and
having a fresh take on the matter from a new contributor is well worth
the reminders.  It's also nice to hear this as a compliment, and not
just a complaint.

At the risk of pushing too hard, you could always turn your (good!)
suggestions into concrete wording, or even request a wiki account to
make the changes yourself. But even if that is beyond your planned level
of involvement, I do hope that various readers will be able to act on
the suggestions in this mail to improve things.

Again, part of the problem may be that gmail is not really suited to the
ideal patch flow, and so that's going to be a pain point for any such
contributor.  Submitting patches as an attachment is harder than the
inline version you get with 'git send-email', but it is one of those
one-off manual fixups that a maintainer can overlook, as long as it
really is a one-off thing and not a repeated pattern.  And yes, we
should document that use of an attachment is the most likely to avoid
mangling the patch if you don't have 'git send-email' working, even if
it is harder for the maintainer to apply such a patch.
