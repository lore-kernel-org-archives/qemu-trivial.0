-device is hardly high level.  It's a thin wrapper around
qdev_device_add(), which adds a bit of convenience to the QOM building
blocks.

Machine creation would probably use a configuration file, and work with
the same QOM building blocks.

Point taken.  However, I'm afraid you've missed my point that hiding
devices from the user should be separate from marking devices that still
defeat device_add.  @user_creatable is about the latter.  Downstreams
sometimes press it into service for the former, which is probably a bad
idea.

The naming of @user_creatable is and has always been political.  Before
it got its current name, it was cannot_instantiate_with_device_add_yet.
This expressed its intent.  I've stopped caring about its name long ago.

If you want to have a flag to hide devices from the user, and you want
to name it user_creatable, go right ahead and rename what's now called
user_creatable to whatever other name you see fit to get it out of the
way.  Just don't press what's now called user_creatable into service for
something else.

Quoting myself some more: "hiding them should be separate from marking
devices that still defeat device_add."

Risking to sound like a broken record...  You want to hide certain
devices from the user because they are (in your reasoned opinion) of no
use to the user.  I'm not going to argue about that.  All I want is you
refrain from abusing what is now called @user_creatable for that
purpose.  Telling me that hiding is a good idea won't persuade me this
abuse would be a good idea.
