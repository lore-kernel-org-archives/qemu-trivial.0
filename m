Hmm, does having a device with both sysbus and pci versions qualify as 
weird? Does adding a comment saying that this way we don't need two more 
reset functions just to call the registered one justifies using 
qemu_register_reset() or this function is deprecated and should not be 
used and should go with the separate reset functions instead?

OK, thanks for the explanation in previous reply as well, I'll do this 
then.
