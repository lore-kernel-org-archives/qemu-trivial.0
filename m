Yes.

We are already relying on indentation elsewhere.  For instance:

    # @fatal: if set, the image is marked corrupt and therefore unusable
    #     after this event and must be repaired (Since 2.2; before, every
    #     `BLOCK_IMAGE_CORRUPTED` event was fatal)
    #
    # .. note:: If action is "stop", a `STOP` event will eventually follow
    #    the `BLOCK_IO_ERROR` event.

The description of @fatal is indented.  A non-indented line ends it.
The non-indented line happens to be a Sphinx directive here, but that's
immaterial (the QAPI doc comment parser does not attempt to parse ReST).

That's deceptive :)

Consider

    ##
    # @HV_BALLOON_STATUS_REPORT:
    #
    # Emitted when the hv-balloon driver receives a "STATUS" message from
    # the guest.
    #
    # .. note:: This event is rate-limited.
    #
    # Since: 8.2
    #
    # .. qmp-example::
    #
    #     <- { "event": "HV_BALLOON_STATUS_REPORT",
    #          "data": { "committed": 816640000, "available": 3333054464 },
    #          "timestamp": { "seconds": 1600295492, "microseconds": 661044=
 } }
    ##
    { 'event': 'HV_BALLOON_STATUS_REPORT',
      'data': 'HvBalloonInfo' }

Rendered documentation looks like

    Event HV_BALLOON_STATUS_REPORT (Since: 8.2)

       Emitted when the hv-balloon driver receives a "STATUS" message from
       the guest.

       Note:

         This event is rate-limited.

       Members:
          * The members of "HvBalloonInfo".

       Example::

          <- { "event": "HV_BALLOON_STATUS_REPORT",
               "data": { "committed": 816640000, "available": 3333054464 },
               "timestamp": { "seconds": 1600295492, "microseconds": 661044=
 } }

Where does "Members:" come from?  Its generated.

If we move "Since:" to the end of the doc comment, we instead get

    Event HV_BALLOON_STATUS_REPORT (Since: 8.2)

       Emitted when the hv-balloon driver receives a "STATUS" message from
       the guest.

       Note:

         This event is rate-limited.

       Example::

          <- { "event": "HV_BALLOON_STATUS_REPORT",
               "data": { "committed": 816640000, "available": 3333054464 },
               "timestamp": { "seconds": 1600295492, "microseconds": 661044=
 } }

       Members:
          * The members of "HvBalloonInfo".

This one is clearly bad.  The fact that an innocent move of "Since:" can
make the rendered docs worse is a defect in the QAPI doc system.

But even the first version isn't quite what we want.  We want Members:
further up, like this:

    Event HV_BALLOON_STATUS_REPORT (Since: 8.2)

       Emitted when the hv-balloon driver receives a "STATUS" message from
       the guest.

       Members:
          * The members of "HvBalloonInfo".

       Note:

         This event is rate-limited.

       Example::

          <- { "event": "HV_BALLOON_STATUS_REPORT",
               "data": { "committed": 816640000, "available": 3333054464 },
               "timestamp": { "seconds": 1600295492, "microseconds": 661044=
 } }

Now we're ready to discuss "intro" vs. "details.  Their separation
matters in this example, because the generated "Members:" go right after
"intro".

The root of the problem is a syntactic ambiguity.  "Intro" is commonly
followed by some "@argument: ...", "Return:", "Error:", or similar.  But
these are all optional.  When they're absent, the what's "intro" and
what's "details" is syntactically ambiguous.

The doc comment I used as example abuses "Since:" to separate them.

This is part of our slow move towards a standard doc comment structure,
ultimately enforced by the generator.  Standard structure helps readers.

"First paragraph is intro" is workable syntax.  It restricts "intro" to
a single paragraph", which is unlikely to be a serious problem.
However, the restriction is easy to forget.  If you write two paragraphs
(because "it is all just some lines of prose"), the rendering can
surprise you, in a bad way.

Having to indent "intro" forces you to be explicit, and avoids
surprises.

Blame it on me: I pushed John towards explicit.
