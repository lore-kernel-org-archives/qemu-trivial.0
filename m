Add documentation comments describing the public API of the
ptimer countdown timer.

I was trying to write a timer device and discovered that the ptimer
API wasn't actually documented, so I wrote some basic notes for it...

+/* The ptimer API implements a simple periodic countdown timer.
+ * The countdown timer has a value (which can be read and written via
+ * ptimer_get_count() and ptimer_set_count()). When it is enabled
+ * using ptimer_run(), the value will count downwards at the frequency
+ * which has been configured using ptimer_set_period() or ptimer_set_freq().
+ * When it reaches zero it will trigger a QEMU bottom half handler, and
+ * can be set to either reload itself from a specified limit value
+ * and keep counting down, or to stop (as a one-shot timer).
+ *
+ * Forgetting to set the period/frequency (or setting it to zero) is a
+ * bug in the QEMU device and will cause warning messages to be printed
+ * to stderr when the guest attempts to enable the timer.
