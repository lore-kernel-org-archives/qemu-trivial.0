Yeah, that was puzzling for me too, but that wasn't the reason
I took this patch (which turned out not to be trivial in the end).

My immediate reaction is - why probe at all once --disable-containers
is given.

There might be different reasons for the error (or lack thereof), but
once it's been told to disable containers, there's no reason to probe
container environment, end of story....

...And this is the actual problem.  It isn't --disable-containers-for-tests.
It is --disable-container.  It's more, the help currently says:

   --disable-containers     don't use containers for cross-building

so it isn't obvious at all this is only used for tests.

And as long as it is actually doing something else, not what the name suggests,
people will try to use it for something it isn't intended for.

As long as these two options (coming together) are interpreted in such
an awkward way, there will be more attempts to do the same, like this one.

(Why this change seemed trivial to me: because it restores the status-quo,
everything seems to match now, disable-containers means empty container
command, end of question).

I re-sent the pull request without this change.  But this should be
fixed one way or another, I think :)

And I should be more careful next time.

Thanks,
