I don't know what other ui backends do but if this makes it more 
consistent with at least gtk it sounds good and a scale options is useful 
in itself even without hiDPI. The ui maintainers should do a final review 
though.

You should post a new thread if you revise a patch with v2 for the first 
revision after initial submission without version and increasing for later 
revisions but adding a scale option should be in a different patch so this 
makes it a series with two patches. Series should be submitted as replies 
to a cover letter with new thread for v2 and so on for revised series as 
well. This should be explained in 
https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/devel/submitting-a-patch.html

Thanks for improving QEMU.
