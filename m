The first sentence is clearly overview, but the second caught my eye.
What would we want the inliner to do with it?

Looks like the inliner isn't going to do anything with it right now,
because BlockGraphInfo is only used as member type.

The first sentence is clearly overview, but the second caught my eye.

Because this is an enum type, and we're not going to inline these, we
can leave it as is.

The first sentence is clearly overview.  What would we want the inliner

Looks like the inliner isn't going to do anything with it right now,
because BackupPerf is only used as member type.

Aside: this only user BackupCommon member x-perf has been @unstable for
more than five years.  That's a long time to sit on a fence.

This is an example of a first paragraph I might flag for review if it

"URLs" are actually member @url of base type BlockdevOptionsCurlBase.

I believe all the problematic first paragraphs consist of more than one
sentence.  What about splitting "trivial" into "very trivial" (just one
paragraph, no sentence-ending punctuation in the middle) and "hopefully
trivial" (just one paragraph, remainder)?
