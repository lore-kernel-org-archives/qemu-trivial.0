Yes, I understand. Yet, POSIX standartized the HP-UX behavior, so all other
systems has become "obscure" this way.

I mean, this weren't a problem until now, for all the decades qemu exists.
Not a problem in practice, that is.

I understand what the problem we have.  And yes it is better to keep such
an FD "dangling" in case of close() returned error and haven't actually
closed the FD, than to close an innocent/reused FD.

Yes, let's pick this commit instead.  No need to re-send.
