My locale output:

    $ locale
    LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    LANGUAGE=
    LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_NUMERIC=zh_CN.UTF-8
    LC_TIME=zh_CN.UTF-8
    LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_MONETARY=zh_CN.UTF-8
    LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_PAPER=zh_CN.UTF-8
    LC_NAME=zh_CN.UTF-8
    LC_ADDRESS=zh_CN.UTF-8
    LC_TELEPHONE=zh_CN.UTF-8
    LC_MEASUREMENT=zh_CN.UTF-8
    LC_IDENTIFICATION=zh_CN.UTF-8
    LC_ALL=

I copy&paste the character from mutt to vim. Let me see if it would work if I
save the character from mutt mail itself.
