Maybe but I think that would not be part of this series but some other 
clean up separately. This series makes it a bit cleaner but does not aim 
to fix everything.

I've tried to add these but vmstate is only added to the PCI version 
because the OHCI device I've looked at also does the same, which is likely 
beacuse the sysbus version is only used on SH4 which does not support 
migration anyway. The PCI verison can be instantiated on machines that 
have migration support so it makes sense to do it there. I hope this is 
acceptable.
